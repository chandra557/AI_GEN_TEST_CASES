\n\n### UNIT TEST CASES for Network MSeries Router MX480\n\n#### Test Case 1: Power On\n- **Test Scenario:** Power on the MSeries Router MX480\n- **Test Steps:**\n  1. Connect the power cable to the router.\n  2. Switch on the power button.\n  3. Check for the power LED indicator.\n- **Expected Result:** The power LED indicator should light up, indicating that the router has successfully powered on.\n\n#### Test Case 2: Interface Configuration\n- **Test Scenario:** Configure interfaces on the MSeries Router MX480\n- **Test Steps:**\n  1. Access the router's command line interface (CLI) through console or SSH.\n  2. Configure interface settings such as IP address, subnet mask, and interface status.\n  3. Verify the configuration by checking the interface status.\n- **Expected Result:** The interface should be successfully configured with the specified settings and the status should be up.\n\n#### Test Case 3: Routing Table\n- **Test Scenario:** Verify routing table functionality on the MSeries Router MX480\n- **Test Steps:**\n  1. View the current routing table entries on the router.\n  2. Add a new route to the routing table.\n  3. Verify that the new route is added correctly and is being used for routing traffic.\n- **Expected Result:** The new route should be successfully added to the routing table and should be used for routing traffic as expected.\n\n```bash\nshow route\nconfigure\nset routing-options static route <destination> next-hop <next-hop-address>\ncommit\n```\n\n#### Test Case 4: High Availability\n- **Test Scenario:** Test high availability features on the MSeries Router MX480\n- **Test Steps:**\n  1. Simulate a failure on one of the redundant components (e.g., power supply, line card).\n  2. Monitor the router's behavior and failover mechanism.\n  3. Restore the failed component and verify the router's recovery.\n- **Expected Result:** The router should demonstrate high availability by smoothly transitioning to redundant components and recovering from the failure without service interruption.\n\n#### Test Case 5: Performance Testing\n- **Test Scenario:** Perform performance testing on the MSeries Router MX480\n- **Test Steps:**\n  1. Generate a high volume of traffic through the router using traffic generators or network tools.\n  2. Monitor the router's CPU and memory utilization during the traffic load.\n  3. Measure the throughput and latency of the router under heavy traffic conditions.\n- **Expected Result:** The router should maintain stable performance with minimal impact on throughput and latency, even under high traffic load.\n\n```bash\nshow system statistics\nstart traffic-generator -traffic <traffic-pattern> -duration <duration>\n```
